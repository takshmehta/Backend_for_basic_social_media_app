In this project I have created backend for a basic social media website. The website has registration, login, profile, questions, upvotes etc routes. User needs to register first and then 
he/she can login using login route , edit profile as well as post questions and answers. For secure login I have used bcryptJs and passport-jwt and can upvote questions as well. Since I have tested this project 
using postman therefor this project does not contains and front-end.
Also I would like to mention, I have created this project under the guidance of Mr.Hitesh Choudhary{https://www.youtube.com/user/hiteshitube}.
